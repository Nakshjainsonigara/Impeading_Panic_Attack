# Digital Phenotyping for Panic Attack Prevention (Research in Progress)  

## Project Overview  
This research explores how digital phenotyping can help predict and mitigate panic attacks by analyzing behavioral patterns from digital interactions. Currently, I am working on preprocessing the data for modeling and plan to document the findings in a structured research report.  

## Model Performance & Next Steps
An XGBoost model has been developed, achieving 90.3% accuracy in predicting panic attacks. The next phase involves enhancing the model with advanced techniques and integrating additional features to improve reliability. I am also exploring IoT-based connectivity to enable real-time monitoring and response mechanisms.

## Open for Collaboration  
This project is in its early stages, and Iâ€™m actively looking for feedback, suggestions, and potential collaborators. Feel free to connect if you're interested in:  
- Sharing insights on digital phenotyping  
- Contributing to data analysis or ML modeling  
- Providing expertise in mental health research or psychology
